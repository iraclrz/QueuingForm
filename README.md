# QueuingForm
This project demonstrates a cashier system's functionality using C#. It features a user-friendly interface with a button that generates unique queue numbers upon clicking. These numbers represent customers waiting for service and are dynamically managed in a list. As customers are served, their numbers are removed from the list. The project showcases efficient service management and real-time updates, leveraging C#'s capabilities in user interaction and data handling. Overall, it illustrates the streamlined operation of modern cashier systems in retail and service environments.
